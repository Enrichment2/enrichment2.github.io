            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><em>Note: "Enrich" is not my real name - I use it online for privacy reasons.</em></p>
            <p>I'm a new developer learning cybersecurity and C++. I have a passion for both the hardware and software sides of computers - from understanding how processors work to writing efficient code that runs on them.</p>
            <p>Currently diving deep into low-level programming, system security, and building my own Linux system from scratch. Every day is a new opportunity to learn something fascinating about how computers really work under the hood.</p>
